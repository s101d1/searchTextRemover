The latest source code of Firefox extension "Clear Search Bar Text On Search" that had been removed from add-ons site.

The extension is created with [Add-on SDK](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Archive/Add-ons/Add-on_SDK) and is not compatible with Firefox Quantum (v57+), but it still works with Waterfox and Pale Moon browsers.

You can find the xpi file in [release page](https://github.com/s101d1/searchTextRemover/releases).
